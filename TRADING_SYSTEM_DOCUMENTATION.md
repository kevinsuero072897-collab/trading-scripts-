```java
public interface Strategy {
    String getName();
    Optional<TradeSignal> evaluate(MarketDataSnapshot snapshot);
    void initialize();
    void reset();
    Map<String, Object> getParameters();
    Map<String, Object> getMetrics();
    boolean isEnabled();
    void setEnabled(boolean enabled);
}
```
